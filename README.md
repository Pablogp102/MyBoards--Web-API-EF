# MyBoards Web API

This project is a part of my portfolio, showcasing my skills and knowledge in developing web applications. The MyBoards Web API manages various work items within a project management system, providing endpoints for tasks, issues, epics, users, comments, and more.

## Introduction

The MyBoards Web API facilitates CRUD operations, pagination, and data manipulation functionalities. It is built using ASP.NET Core framework and utilizes Entity Framework Core for database interactions.

## Technologies Used

### Backend

- **ASP.NET Core**: Framework for building APIs and web applications.
- **Entity Framework Core**: Object-relational mapping (ORM) framework for database interactions.
- **MS SQL Server**: Database management system for storing application data.
- **Swagger UI**: Allows for easy API exploration and testing.
- **C#**: Primary programming language used in the backend development.

### Features

1. **CRUD Operations**: Ability to Create, Read, Update, and Delete work items, users, comments, etc.
2. **Pagination**: Support for paginated data retrieval to handle large datasets efficiently.
3. **Database Migrations**: Utilization of Entity Framework Core's migration feature for database schema management.
4. **Swagger Documentation**: Automatically generated API documentation for easy exploration and testing.
5. **Data Filtering and Sorting**: Capability to filter and sort data based on user-defined criteria.
6. **Data Seeding**: Automatic seeding of initial data into the database.
7. **Error Handling**: Implementation of error handling mechanisms to ensure application robustness.
8. **Dependency Injection**: Leveraging ASP.NET Core's built-in dependency injection for managing component dependencies.

## Learning Outcomes

1. **ASP.NET Core Development**: Enhanced proficiency in building web APIs using ASP.NET Core framework.
2. **Entity Framework Core**: Deepened understanding of ORM concepts and practical usage of Entity Framework Core for database interactions.
3. **Swagger Integration**: Learned to integrate Swagger for API documentation, improving API usability and developer experience.
4. **Database Management**: Hands-on experience in database management using MS SQL Server, including migrations, data seeding, and querying.
5. **C# Programming**: Strengthened C# programming skills, especially in the context of web development.
6. **RESTful API Design**: Understanding of RESTful principles and best practices in designing and implementing web APIs.
7. **Error Handling and Logging**: Implementation of error handling and logging mechanisms for better application monitoring and maintenance.
8. **Deployment**: Knowledge of deploying ASP.NET Core applications to various hosting environments for production use.

## Conclusion

The MyBoards Web API project demonstrates my ability to develop robust and scalable backend solutions for web applications. It showcases my proficiency in ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework Core, database management, and other relevant technologies. This project serves as a testament to my continuous learning and growth as a web developer.
